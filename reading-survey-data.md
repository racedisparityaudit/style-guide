title: Reading survey data
---

Some of the data on this website comes from surveys. 

Surveys are often less reliable than other forms of data collection. This is because they collect responses from a sample of a group, rather than the group as a whole. For example, asking 10% of parents their opinion on changing the curriculum rather than asking all parents.  
 
Statisticians therefore use techniques to:

* make survey data more reliable and representative of the population – this is known as ‘weighting’
* assess the reliability of estimates and differences between them using ‘confidence intervals’

## Weighting

Weighting adjusts the results of a survey so they better represent the population as a whole. It can also make results more reliable.

For example, a survey of 25 women and 75 men may not reflect the views of the general population. Statisticians may weight the results to more accurately represent the split of men and women in the general population. 

Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population.

## Confidence intervals

Confidence intervals tell us how confident we can be that a survey estimate represents the wider population.

For example, 2017/18 data showed that 22.4% of all 4 to 5 year olds in England were overweight. This is only an estimate. The real figure was somewhere between 22.3% and 22.5%. These are the ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ bounds.

Confidence intervals show how likely it is that the real figure falls within the upper and lower bounds. For example, a confidence interval of 95% means if we took 100 random samples, the figure would fall within its upper and lower bounds 95 times.

Confidence intervals can also show how reliable differences are, for example between 2 ethnic groups.

Differences are reliable if their 95% confidence intervals don't overlap. (In other words, if the upper bound of one group doesn’t overlap with the lower band of another.)

Confidence intervals that do overlap are not ‘statistically significant’. This means the findings do not represent the wider population.

## The limits of survey data 

Even using weighting and confidence intervals, it’s important to treat all survey data with caution. 

In particular, where survey data is broken down by ethnicity, gender, age or region for example, the numbers of people involved can get very small. 

If they get too small, the figures will be unavailable (or ‘suppressed’) because they’ll be too unreliable to use. 

If estimates are consistent over several years, this can offset uncertainty about findings from individual years.
