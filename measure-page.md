title: Measure page guidance
---

A measure page represents data which has been analysed according to 1 or more ‘dimensions’ (sometimes called ‘analyses’). It’s good practice to include dimensions by:

* ethnicity
* ethnicity over time
* ethnicity and gender
* ethnicity and age
* ethnicity and area

The [Unemployment measure page](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/unemployment-and-economic-inactivity/unemployment/latest) is a good example.

Each of these dimensions can be illustrated with a chart and/or table, and a summary.

The commentary on the measure page is organised into different sections, to meet the needs of a wide variety of users.

Use these guidelines to complete or update your commentary for a measure page.

## Basic information

### Title

A plain English version of what the data measures. Use terms people are likely to search for, and front-load the most important content.

Bad example:

> Households by ethnic group of head and total weekly household income, three-year averages, United Kingdom

Good example:

> Household income

### Time period

The time period the data covers. See the [Style guide A to Z](/a-z#dates-and-date-ranges) for date formulations.

### Area covered

The geographical area the data covers.

### Lowest level of geography

Choose one of the following:

* United Kingdom
* Country (for example, England, Wales, England and Wales, Scotland)
* Region (for example, South West, London, North West, Wales)
* Local authority upper tier (for example, county council, unitary authority, Greater London Authority) – applies to England only
* Local authority lower tier (for example, district council, unitary authority, London borough) – applies to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
* Police force area
* Clinical commissioning group

If other, please contact the team to arrange for another option to be added.

If you don’t know whether your data includes lower or upper tier local authorities, you can download a lookup file of [local authorities in England and Wales](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/lower-tier-local-authority-to-upper-tier-local-authority-december-2017-lookup-in-england-and-wales).

## Data sources: primary source

### Title of data source

The name of the data source (for example, Annual Population Survey). This should match the title of the page given as the data source URL.

### Type of data

Choose one or both of the following:

* Administrative
* Survey (including census)

### Statistic type

Choose one of the following:

* National Statistics
* Official statistics
* Experimental statistics
* Non-official statistics (not produced by a government department or agency)


### Publishing department

The department responsible for analysing and/or publishing the data (for example, Department for Education).

### Source URL

Provide a link to the data source used for the measure. Users should be able to find the source data easily from the page given as the source URL.

The link should usually be the landing page for the statistics publication, rather than a PDF, spreadsheet or GOV.UK ‘collections’ page.

> For example, for the 2017 Key Stage 1 measures, the correct URL is [Phonics screening check and key stage 1 assessments: England 2017](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/phonics-screening-check-and-key-stage-1-assessments-england-2017), not [Statistics: key stage 1](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-key-stage-1) (collections page) or the [statistical first release PDF](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/654859/Phonics_KS1_SFR_Text_2017_.pdf).

If the source data is not published, link to a page that best describes the data or survey.

### Publication release date

When the data being used for the measure was published.

If the measure doesn’t use the first publication, enter the date when the version it uses was published.

Use the format dd/mm/yyyy (for example, 11/05/2018).

### Note on corrections or updates

Note here if:

* the measure doesn’t use the first publication of the source data – for example, ‘This measure uses the revised Key Stage 2 data published by the Department for Education, rather than the provisional data from the first publication’
* the source data has been updated but the update doesn’t affect the ethnicity statistics (and therefore we haven’t used it)

### Publication frequency

Choose one of the following:

* Monthly
* Quarterly
* 3 times a year
* Twice a year
* Yearly
* Every 2 years
* Every 3 years
* Every 4 years
* Every 5 years
* Ad hoc
* Other

If other, please specify.

### Purpose of data source

Why is government (or another body) collecting this data?

Example from [Reading attainments for children aged 7 to 11](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/7-to-11-years-old/reading-attainments-for-children-aged-7-to-11-key-stage-2/latest):

> The primary purpose is to measure schools and pupils progress and performance from key stage 1 to key stage 2 to monitor and improve standards and inform parental choice when applying to local schools.

## Secondary source

If there’s a secondary source, complete the secondary source section in the same way that you completed the primary source details.

> For example, see [Access to NHS dental services](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/access-to-treatment/access-to-nhs-dental-services/latest#data-source-details), the data for which is published on the NHS Outcomes Framework (primary source), but derived from the GP Patient Survey (secondary source).

## Commentary

### Main points

This section is intended for high-level findings about the data, serving as an instant takeaway for users.

Its content should therefore:

* summarise the most important findings on the page (across all the dimensions analysed)
* help users unfamiliar with charts and tables understand what they’re looking at (for example, figures quoted in the commentary which users can also find in the charts and tables help make sense of both)
* where possible, work as stand-alone statements (as they may be quoted out of context)
* alert users to serious caveats about the quality of the data
* supply context where appropriate (for example, ‘14.3 million (63%) of the estimated 22.6 million households in England in 2015/16 were in home ownership’)
* be written in between 6 and 8 bullet points

### Things you need to know

Use this section to explain factors that might lead users to misinterpret or misunderstand the data, for example:

* sample sizes, suppression, missing data
* changes in methodology over time
* other limitations in the quality or reliability of the data
* the application of statistical methods like weighting and age standardisation
* the size of the group with unknown ethnicity, and whether they’ve been included when calculating values like percentages

Even quite complex statistical concepts can and should be translated into plain English for users.

Sometimes, it’s helpful to offer a simplified version of a statistical caveat or test, and refer specialist users to ‘Methodology’ or ‘Download the data’ for more detailed and/or technical information.

See the [Style guide A to Z](/a-z) for boilerplated plain English explanations for specialist concepts.

### What the data measures

Use this section to add context and background to the data. For example:

* what this data tells users – for example, ‘This data measures how likely people in different ethnic groups are to own their own homes’
* the source of the data – for example, ‘The figures are drawn from the 2014/15 and 2015/16 English Housing Survey (EHS)’
* technical aspects that need further explanation – for example, ‘some households contain people from different ethnic backgrounds; in these circumstances, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person to define the ethnic background of the household’
* plain English definitions of terms used in the measure – for example, ‘Young people’ means people aged 10 to 17 years’
* what’s included where ‘other’ is used to categorise certain parts of the data – for example, ‘Types of crime under ‘Other offences’ include:...’

Translate complex statistical concepts into plain English for users, referring to the [Style guide A to Z](/a-z) where needed.

### Why these ethnic categories were chosen

UK government organisations use a variety of different lists of ethnicities. These lists also change over time to reflect the nation’s changing population.

Although the Office of National Statistics (ONS) set out a standardised list of ethnicities in the 2011 Census, in practice there is no single standard across the public sector.

Use this section to explain, in plain English, the ethnic categorisation in this measure page and why it is used.

See the [Style guide A to Z](/a-z#ethnic-categories) for the most common ethnic categorisations.

## Methodology

### Methodology

The UK Statistics Authority’s Code of Practice is clear that transparency is important to maintain public trust in statistics:

> Transparent judgements about statistical definitions and methods, together with judgements about strengths and limitations, are essential in supporting confidence in the quality of the statistics. [Five whys: the Code of Practice](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/five-whys-the-code-of-practice/)

Use ‘Things you need to know’ to provide the non-specialist user with honest and clearly expressed caveats about the limitations of the data.

Use ‘Methodology’ to give statisticians, specialists and experts in the field a detailed methodological description.

The language in this section may need to be more specialist and technical than the commentary elsewhere. However it should be as accessible as possible to the interested non-specialist.

Include information about the following if they apply to your data:

* sample size, including limitations on covering the whole population
* collection methods, including sample selection and possible sample biases
* response rates, and non-response biases
* whether any significance tests were done (for example, overlapping intervals or t tests) and how they were done
* whether analysing the data by ethnicity has any quality or methodological implications that aren’t covered in the QMI document
* age standardisation – how and why it was applied
* weighting
* confidence intervals

Content on weighting and confidence intervals should be given separate subheads and be listed last in the methodology section.

See the [Style guide A to Z](/a-z) for boilerplated plain English explanations for specialist concepts.

### Suppression rules and disclosure control

Specify here if data has been excluded from the analysis to protect confidentiality, because small sample sizes make it unreliable, or for any other reason.

If no data has been excluded, leave this section blank.

### Rounding

Specify the rounding rules used in commentary and data.

See the [data style guide](/data-style-guide#rounding) for rules on rounding.

### Related publications

Use this section to list further reading or related data sets.

Example from [Reading attainments for children aged 7 to 11](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/7-to-11-years-old/reading-attainments-for-children-aged-7-to-11-key-stage-2/latest):

> [Schools, pupils and their characteristics: January 2016](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their-characteristics-january-2016)

### Quality Methodology Information URL

Give a link to the data’s quality methodology report.

### Further technical information

Please supply any other information you think is relevant.

Example from [Illicit drug use among adults](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their-characteristics-january-2016):

> [Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey: Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014](http://digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB21748)

## Downloads

Please specify what the download file contains, for example:

> This file contains the following: measure, ethnicity, year, geography, gender, age group, NS-SEC (socio-economic group), income, region, value, denominator, numerator, confidence intervals (upper bound, lower bound).

See the [data style guide](/data-style-guide#download-files) for more information.

## Contact details

Give the name, email address and phone number of the departmental person you are working with (rather than the statistician who worked on the original publications or sources). This information is not visible to users, but it will be useful if a team member needs to contact them.

You can add a second contact if needed.

## Dimensions

### Title

Create a plain English version of the data dimension. Remember that ‘by ethnicity’ comes first, followed by a second or third cut of the data.

Bad example:

> 16 to 64 year olds not in full-time education who are employed, by highest qualification and ethnicity

Good example:

> Employment, by ethnicity and qualification level

See the data style guide for more guidance on [dimension, chart and table titles](https://guide.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/data-style-guide#titles-of-dimensions-charts-and-tables).

### Time period

The time period this dimension of the data covers. If the chart and table cover different time periods, write the longest time period here.

### Summary

Use the summary to comment in detail on the findings presented in this dimension.

Content should:

* avoid repetition of the 'Main points' section by providing detail specific to this dimension
* draw out the important and reliable findings and trends over time
* alert users to serious caveats about the quality of the data
* where possible, work as stand-alone statements (as they may be quoted out of context)
* avoid simply repeating the numbers in the tables and charts
* avoid overloading users with information they can’t absorb
* account for differences visible in the charts which aren’t meaningful
* be written in between 6 and 8 bullet points

The example below, taken from [Overweight adults](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/health/preventing-illness/overweight-adults/latest) illustrates the difference between a measure’s main points and summary.

Main points:

> the percentage of White adults and Black adults who were overweight in the period 2013 to 2015 was higher than the average for all adults in England

Summary:

> in the period 2013 to 2015, the percentage of adults who were overweight was 66% for White people and 67% for Black people, both higher than the average for all adults in England

### Ethnicity categorisation

Choose the ethnicity categories that have been used to analyse the data in this dimension. If the chart and table use different categories, select the most detailed one.

Under ‘Other values’, tick the checkboxes to show whether the chart or table also include values for:

* broad ethnic groups (if a detailed categorisation has been used)
* ‘All’ ethnic groups
* the ‘Unknown’ ethnic group
